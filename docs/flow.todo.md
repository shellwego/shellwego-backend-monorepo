Give me diff patches for 7. Missing "Sovereign" Safety . how many parts? Give me the 1/x first

Understand readme.md then spot any misalignment, non DRYness etc in codebase. Note; we are in skeletons scaffolding phase with //TODOs comments across methods ... Make sure to mentions corresponding paths files while explaining

Execute biggest win number 2 of lib.guide.md ... Make sure you are producing skeletons scaffolding without any logic code. Just //TODO commentd of methods

understand the readme.md then make sure the codebase boilerplate is enough to achieve the purpose. rules: you are at scaffolding with //TODO phase only. should not write logic. only yhe skeletons

send me all the skeletons files of ⚠️ Missing Scaffolding (Structural Gaps) without logic in 6 parts, only with scaffolding //TODOs comments of method. with below format precisely for auto-Script to split code blocks into their correct file paths.

**`test/file.txt`**
```
Hello, World!
This is test content.
```

**`another/file.rs`**
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello");
}
```
